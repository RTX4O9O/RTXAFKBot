## Welcome

**Fake Player Plugin (FPP)** is an advanced bot-spoofing plugin for Paper 1.21+ servers.  
It spawns realistic fake players that appear in the **tab list**, **server list**, **join/leave messages**, and as physical **Mannequin entities** in the world — indistinguishable from real players at a glance.
